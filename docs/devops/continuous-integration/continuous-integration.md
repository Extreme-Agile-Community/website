# Continuous Integration

:::note TL;DR;
continuous integration is a key DevOps practice that allows frequent code integration and automated testing, enabling rapid software delivery with reduced bugs and issues. It relies on version control, test automation and continuous processes.
:::

## Definition

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. 

## Goals

- Detect errors and bugs early through frequent automated testing
- Improve software quality through regular code integration and testing
- Reduce time to validate and release new updates by automating build and test processes
- Improve developer productivity by reducing integration issues


## Practices

- Maintaining a code repository (e.g. Git) for developers to regularly commit code
- Automatically building the code and running tests whenever changes are committed
- Quickly fixing any issues that are detected by automated tests
- Frequently integrating code changes from multiple developers rather than long integration periods
- Extensive use of test automation, including unit, integration and acceptance tests
- Providing rapid feedback on build and test results to developers
- Using a CI server or cloud service to automate the build, test and reporting process
