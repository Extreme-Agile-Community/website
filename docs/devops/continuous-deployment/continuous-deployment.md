# Continuous Deployment

:::note TL;DR;
Continuous Deployment is a key DevOps practice that automates the entire software release process. Every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline is released to the customers, which results in many production deployments every day. It relies on robust testing, monitoring, and quick recovery mechanisms to ensure high-quality software delivery.
:::

## Definition

Continuous Deployment is a software development practice where changes in the source code are automatically tested and deployed to production without human intervention. It is an extension of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) that aims to minimize the lead time to deploy changes to the end users.

## Goals

- Deliver updates and new features to end users as quickly as possible.
- Reduce the risks associated with releases by making deployments a routine task.
- Improve software quality by getting quick feedback from end users.
- Increase developer productivity by eliminating manual deployment steps.

## Practices

- Use of a version control system where all changes are committed.
- Comprehensive automated testing to ensure that any change to the code base will not break the existing functionality.
- Automated deployment process to push changes to production.
- Robust monitoring and logging to quickly identify and resolve issues in production.
- Rollback capabilities to revert changes if any issue is detected in production.
