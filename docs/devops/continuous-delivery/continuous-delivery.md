# Continuous Delivery

:::note TL;DR;
Continuous Delivery is a key DevOps practice that ensures software is always in a state that can be deployed to production, enabling faster and more reliable software releases. It relies on version control, test automation, deployment automation, and close collaboration between teams.
:::

## Definition

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It expands upon Continuous Integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage.

## Goals

- Ensure software is always in a releasable state throughout its lifecycle.
- Enable faster, more reliable software releases.
- Improve developer productivity by reducing the complexities of deployment.
- Enable faster feedback loop by pushing changes to users quickly and learning from user feedback.

## Practices

- Use of a version control system where all changes are committed.
- Automated testing to validate the correctness of the code.
- Automated deployment process to push changes to different environments.
- Infrastructure management as code to ensure consistency across environments.
- Close collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
- Monitoring and logging to quickly identify and resolve issues in production.
