# Automated testing

:::node TL;DR;
Automated Testing is a key practice in software development that uses automation tools to execute predefined test cases, compare the actual results with the expected results, and report the test results. It is used to automate repetitive tasks and other testing tasks which are difficult to perform manually, thereby increasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and coverage of software testing.

## Definition

Automated testing is a method in software testing where test cases are executed using automated testing tools with little to no human intervention. This approach is used to re-run the test scenarios that were performed manually, quickly, and repeatedly.

## Goals

Increase the speed and efficiency of testing processes.
Improve the accuracy of test execution by eliminating human errors.
Enable frequent and thorough testing to improve software quality.
Free up the QA team to focus on more complex tests.

## Practices

- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or units of a software.
- Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between different software modules.
- Functional Testing: Testing the functionality of the software application.
- Regression Testing: Testing the application to make sure that changes or updates haven't broken any existing functionality.
- Load Testing: Testing the performance of the software under heavy loads.
