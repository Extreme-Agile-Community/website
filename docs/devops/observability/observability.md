# Observability

:::note TL;DR;
Observability is a key aspect of system and application monitoring that provides insights into the health, performance, and behavior of a system. It relies on data from logs, metrics, and traces to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's state.

# Definition

Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. In the context of software engineering, observability typically refers to the ability to understand the state of a system or application by examining its outputs, logs, metrics, and traces.

## Goals

- Understand the behavior of the system and diagnose issues.
- Monitor system health and performance.
- Gain insights into user behavior and system usage.
- Improve system reliability and performance.
- The main components of Observability include:

## Components

- **Logs**: Detailed records of events happening in the system.
- **Metrics**: Numerical data measured over intervals of time, such as response time, error rate, or resource usage.
- **Traces**: Information about how a request moves through a system, useful for understanding the flow of transactions or requests.
